The Art of War in its highest point of view is policy, but no doubt, a policy which fights battles instead of writing notes. . . . War is an instrument of policy . . . is therefore policy itself, which takes up the sword in place of pen.'' Battles instead of notes? Swords instead of pens? Since 9/11 there has been an unmistakably Clausewitzian flavor to American foreign policy. War, it seems, has made a comeback this year as a legitimate tool for ''the continuation of political intercourse.'' At West Point in June, President Bush revived the traditional 19th-century doctrine of ''pre-emptive'' war, the argument for which was set forth more fully three months later by the White House in a 33-page document titled ''The National Security Strategy of the United States.'' Because ''deliverable weapons of mass destruction in the hands of a terror network or murderous dictator . . . constitute as grave a threat as can be imagined,'' the United States has claimed the right to initiate hostilities to forestall any ''mortal threat'' to its security.

It is hard to imagine the day when we say goodbye to the last survivor of the Second World War, so large do the ''good war'' and the ''greatest generation'' still loom in the national imagination. But the calendar and the census do not lie. Some 16 million Americans served in the military during World War II. On the 60th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor in 2001, about 5.5 million were still living. This year, as we prepare to mark the 70th anniversary, the number is closer to 1.5 million, and it drops by almost a thousand a day. The passage of time doesn't just turn life into history; it also changes the contours of history itself. Over the last several years, historians, philosophers and others have begun to think about the Second World War in challenging and sometimes disturbing new ways, reflecting the growing distance between the country that fought the war and the country that remembers it. As always when history is debated, the stakes are not just the past but the present and future as well. Even as the long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have made Americans less confident about the ways we use our military power, the struggle with the Axis remains the classic example of American might deployed for virtuous ends. President Obama had that history in mind when he explained his decision to intervene in Libya's civil war: ''To brush aside America's responsibility as a leader and -- more profoundly -- our responsibilities to our fellow human beings under such circumstances would have been a betrayal of who we are,'' Obama said. ''Some nations may be able to turn a blind eye to atrocities in other countries. The United States of America is different.''

Scarcely a speech, briefing or interview was being given that failed to mention the laws of war. The Iraqi regime, for its part, was broadcasting denunciations of American airstrikes replete with images of corpses and wounded civilians in hospitals; the United States responded that Iraq had systematically situated military targets and equipment in the midst of civilian areas. The sheer frequency of these references on all sides belied the ancient maxim inter arma silent leges -- in time of war law is silent. People throughout the world obviously care about what is called jus in bello, law governing conduct during war. This is so even if they differ about jus ad bellum, law governing not the conduct of war but rather the resort to force itself.
