Mr. Christopher, who will be sentenced on Nov. 7, faces a maximum prison sentence of 20 years. According to the State Division of Criminal Justice, Mr. Christopher told the American Red Cross on Nov. 14, 2001, that his wife, Kim Christopher, was working in the World Trade Center during the attack.

Using the pseudonym of Mark Palmerri, he also reported another wife, Lisa Palmerri, missing in applications between Sept. 11, 2001, and Jan. 9, 2002, to the Red Cross and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The original building was destroyed in the trade center attack. Although Mr. Silverstein has been at odds with Industrial Risk Insurers over the value of the property, he has started building a $700 million skyscraper on the site, at Washington and Vesey Streets.

The Soros group, the Open Society Institute, will give $2.5 million to 29 nonprofit organizations nationwide. The largest grant, $350,000, will go to the Tides Foundation for its fund for Arab, Muslim, Sikh and South Asian organizations responding to ''erosions of civil liberties and rights.'' Unlike other Soros philanthropies that promote democracy internationally, the Open Society said its mission was to correct what it sees as deficiencies in American democracy.
